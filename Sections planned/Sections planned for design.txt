For a synchronous buck converter with MCU control, your design should include these main sections:
Power Stage

High-side and low-side MOSFETs (or integrated driver IC)
Gate driver circuit with bootstrap capacitor for high-side drive
Input capacitor bank (low ESR)
Output inductor
Output capacitor bank (low ESR)

Sensing and Feedback

Output voltage sense (resistor divider to ADC)
Output current sense (shunt resistor or integrated MOSFET sensing)
Input voltage monitoring
Temperature sensing (MOSFETs, inductor)

MCU Control Section

PWM generation (hardware timer/PWM peripheral)
ADC inputs for voltage/current monitoring
Control algorithm implementation (voltage mode or current mode control)
Protection logic (overcurrent, overvoltage, overtemperature)

Power Supply for Control Circuits

Bias supply for MCU and gate drivers (could be linear regulator from input, or separate supply)
Isolated or referenced supply for high-side gate driver

Protection and Auxiliary

Input reverse polarity protection
Output overvoltage protection
Enable/soft-start circuit
Status indicators (LEDs)

Communication (optional but useful)

UART/I2C/CAN for monitoring and parameter adjustment
Debug interface
